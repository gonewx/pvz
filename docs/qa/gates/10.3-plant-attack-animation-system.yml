# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "10.3"
story_title: "植物攻击动画系统"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "All implementation complete with excellent code quality. Automated test coverage达标 (80.5% vs 80% target). Only manual animation smoothness verification (AC 6) remains."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - animation system is client-side visual logic"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimized state checking (only processes Attacking state), batch processing all plants"
  reliability:
    status: PASS  # ✅ Upgraded from CONCERNS
    notes: "Test coverage达标 (80.5%). Error handling is defensive and tested"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code is well-structured, uses type-safe generics, follows ECS principles, detailed comments"

code_quality_highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Correct architectural decision:废弃 Story 6.4 动画叠加，使用简单切换（符合原版机制）"
    - "Clear state machine: Idle ↔ Attacking with IsFinished detection"
    - "Type-safe generics: All ECS operations use Epic 9 generic API"
    - "Defensive error handling: Animation failures log but don't crash game"
    - "Extensible design: IsShooterPlant() helper supports future plant types"
    - "Fixed resource bug: Corrected PeaShooter → PeaShooterSingle in plant_card_factory.go"
  improvements_made:
    - "Fixed attack animation end state selection: anim_full_idle for peashooter (includes head)"
    - "Explicit initialization of AttackAnimState to AttackAnimIdle in all plant factories"
    - "Corrected resource name mapping for peashooter (5 files affected)"
