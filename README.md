## 🎮 Introduction

This project is a faithful recreation of the classic tower defense game "Plants vs. Zombies" (PC Chinese Anniversary Edition), focusing on learning and practicing Go game development. It adopts the modern Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture pattern, implements type-safe game logic using Go generics, and aims for 100% reproduction of the original front yard daytime level experience.

**Key Features:**
- 🏗️ **ECS Architecture** - Type-safe ECS framework based on Go generics
- 🎨 **Original Animations** - Complete implementation of the Reanim skeletal animation system
- ✨ **Particle Effects** - XML configuration-driven particle system
- 📊 **Data-Driven** - YAML configuration files for game data management
- 🎯 **High Fidelity** - Precise recreation of original game values and behaviors

- **Graphics**: OpenGL 2.1+ support

### Installation & Running

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gonewx/pvz
cd pvz

# 2. Download dependencies
go mod download

# 3. Run the game
go run .
```

The game will launch in an 800x600 window.

### Building Executables

```bash
# Build using Makefile (recommended)
make build                # Build for current platform
make build-linux          # Build for Linux (amd64 + arm64)
make build-windows        # Build for Windows (amd64 + arm64)
make build-darwin         # Build for macOS (requires macOS host)
make build-wasm           # Build for WebAssembly

# Manual build
go build -o pvz-go .

# Build optimized version (smaller size)
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o pvz-go .
```

### Building Release Version with Icons

```bash
# Generate Windows icon resources (.syso)
make generate-icons

# Package Linux release (with icons and .desktop)
make package-linux

# Build macOS .app bundle (requires macOS)
make build-darwin-app

# Build Android APK
make build-apk

# View iOS icon usage instructions
make ios-icons-info
```
